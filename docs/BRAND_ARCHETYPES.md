## How to Use These Archetypes & Palettes

1. **Choose an Archetype**: Align it with your brand's or product's core values and motivations.

2. **Pick or Adapt a Palette**: Use the suggested color combos as a springboard. Tweak hex codes to better fit your context or brand identity.

3. **Incorporate Consistently**: Apply the archetype's color palette to your backgrounds, UI elements, calls to action, and highlights. Keep it coherent—avoid mixing multiple archetype palettes in one product unless you have a solid reason.

4. **Match Design Elements**: Combine typography style (serif vs. sans-serif vs. playful) with shapes (rounded vs. sharp corners) and imagery (photos, icons, or illustrations) that best represent the chosen archetype's personality.

**Important**: Colors and archetypes can be culturally dependent or vary in emotional resonance across audiences. The examples above reflect common associations in Western design/branding but can be adapted further for global contexts.

## Summary

- 12 Archetypes → Each has a meaning (core motivation) + design direction (visual tone + shape + imagery style)
- Color Palettes → Typically 3 main roles: primary (dominant UI color), secondary (supporting backgrounds or accent surfaces), accent (buttons, highlights, calls to action)
- Each palette or combination aims to amplify the essence of the archetype—whether that's rebellious boldness for the Outlaw or romantic warmth for the Lover
- By mixing color psychology with brand archetype theory, you can craft a distinct brand or product identity that instantly resonates with users at a deeper, emotional level
